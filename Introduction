## Be-stars
Be-stars are a special type of B-stars that are rapidly rotating and have a ring surounding its equator (decretion circumstrellar disk). 
The mechanism responsible for the disk material ejection from the central star is not well undestood. 
This circumstellar disk produces emission lines and the strongest are the Balmer lines; besides Hydrogen lines there are many FeII emission lines that also
originate in the disk. The H-alpha is the brightest (red) visible spectral line in the Balmer Series. Profile line properties are related with the structure, 
geometry and dynamics of the disk. This project used ML algorithms to study Be-spectral lines, and to product insights of the disk dynamics, as well to understand the region where where each type of profile was generated.
**Discusion: ** Separate spectral lines in two categories, the ones produced by stars with disk and those produced by stars without disk. S. For stars with disk, group them in three types, pole on, edge on and intermediate inclination.

Use unsupervised learning algorithms (clustering or Complete Linkage Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering) to find native groups and use a bottom up approach (ascending) to build hierarchical cluster trees (dendrograms). Elbow method and Silhouette coefficient where used to asses the optimal number of clusters.
**Conclusion:**The H-alpha lines produced by the disk are double peak, the peak separation is strongly realted to the disk inclination respect to the plane of observation.
